  <p>The Cloud-Controlled Smart Switch</p>
  <p>This is a group project from my engineering design lab. The Cloud-Controlled Smart Switch was designed to enhance safety by reducing the risks associated with leaving home appliances on, such as potential fire hazards. It provides a simple and convenient way to remotely control and monitor appliances via a web interface.</p>
  <p>In this project, I was responsible for the front-end programming, focusing on the design and functionality of the website using HTML and CSS. Additionally, I implemented JavaScript to enable virtual interactions with the ESP32 microcontroller. This involved sending HTTP requests to toggle a relay switch, allowing users to control an appliance by turning it on and off.</p> <p>Feel free to explore this project further on my GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/sabrinaa3/The-Cloud-Controlled-Smart-Switch" target="_blank">The Cloud-Controlled Smart Switch</a>.</p>
